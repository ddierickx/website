#### Education & certificates
Obtained my Bachelor degree in Applied Computer Science from Hogeschool Ghent in 2007. Continued my studies at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and obtained my Master degree in 2009.

I also had the opportunity to obtain some Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist certificates:

- .NET Framework - Application Development Foundation
- .NET Framework 3.5, Windows Forms Applications
- SQL Server 2008, Database Development

#### Interests
As a technology enthousiast, these are awesome times to live in. The momentum generated by communities is incredible and almost anything can be created, modded or hacked. I'm interested in open technologies that allow building amazing things fast and relatively easy. I have some (professional) experience with Android application development, I love learning new, tangible Arduino stuff and hacking together Python scripts.

Along with all the new tools, new applications are available that are capable of collecting, aggregating and exposing information in ways never seen before. By analyzing this data, patterns and new trends can be detected. I'm interested in deriving new information from that big heap and in examining ways in which these system can interoperate, fast!
As a developer, I specialize in developing interoperable and scalable back-end Java and .NET systems and services within a service-oriented architecture.

#### Technologies
In my professional carreer as a software engineer, I have built many projects using Microsoft technologies (.NET, Silverlight, SQL Server). A while ago, I decided to get out of my comfort zone and take a leap of faith; so I abandoned the Microsoft stack in favor of Java, PostgreSQL, Python and JavaScript. This evolution forced me to look at things from another perspective and has been an awesome experience so far. I believe it has made me a better software engineer; after all it's all about picking the right tool for the job!
