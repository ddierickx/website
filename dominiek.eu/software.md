#### Personal projects

##### RSDownloader (no longer maintained)

RSDownloader is a download manager application for the Rapidshare.com file sharing service. The project is no longer maintained though. In its days (2007-2010), the application had about 30000 downloads and was translated by the community into nine languages. Its ease of use and features made it pretty popular.

Here are some old screenshots:
