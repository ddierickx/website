###Introduction
Yes, yes, I sold a little piece of my soul and bank account and bought myself an iPhone 4S. Apart from the price tag, the only doubt I had was the due to the
closed nature of all Apple products. Seems its not all that closed though, with a little work, you can get Siri on the iPhone to just about anything you want except the dishes.
In this article, I will discuss the steps that were needed to add some custom functionality to Siri. With these steps, Siri will respond to the command "What's on TV?".
It will display a list of TV programmes and you can even ask for a summary for that program.
